Welcome to my collection of Python projects developed during my Python internship at Codveda Technologies.

These projects cover a variety of applications including CLI tools, games, data processing, web scraping, cryptocurrency tracking, and basic file encryption.

üõ†Ô∏è Projects Overview


1. Simple Calculator

File: simple_calculator.py

Description: A command-line calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).

Usage: Run the script and follow the prompts to input numbers and choose an operation.


2. Number Guessing Game

File: guess_game.py

Description: A fun interactive game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number.

Features:

Provides hints if the guess is too high or too low

Continues until the correct number is guessed

3. Word Counter

File: word_counter.py

Associated File: test.txt

Description: Counts the frequency of words in a given text file.

Usage:

Place the text to analyze in test.txt

Run the script to display word frequencies


4. To-Do List Application

File: todo.py

Associated File: task.json

Description: A command-line tool for managing tasks.

Features:

Add, view, delete, and mark tasks as complete

Data persists in task.json for future sessions


5. Web Scraper

File: webScraper.py

Associated File: data.csv

Description: Extracts data from websites for analysis or storage.

Usage:

Fetched data is saved in data.csv

Can be adapted for scraping product info, news, or other structured data


6. Cryptocurrency Price Checker

File: cryptoCurrency-price.py

Description: Fetches and displays the current price of a specified cryptocurrency using APIs.

Usage:

Run the script and input the cryptocurrency symbol to get its latest price


7. File Encryption & Decryption

Files: generateAkey.py, encryptfile.py, decryptefile.py

Associated Files:

toBeSecret.txt (original file to encrypt)

myTopSecretInfo.txt (content to encrypt)

decrypted.txt (output after decryption)

myTopSecretKey.key (encryption key)

Description:

generateAkey.py: Generates a key for encrypting files

encryptfile.py: Encrypts a file using the generated key

decryptefile.py: Decrypts the file back to its original content

Usage:

First, generate a key

Encrypt the file using the key

Decrypt when needed to restore original content
